This repo will download a public docker image that has all the required dependencies for AWS CLI. Once you run the run_container.sh script, it will spin up the container and place you inside a bash shell.

Make sure to go in and edit the config and credential files to place your AWS access keys and region settings. Then you can rock and roll
